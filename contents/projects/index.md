<p class="large">Iâ€™m an Australian designer currently working at [This Little Duck](https://thislittleduck.com) in Sydney where I lead the design direction on our projects. Some of our clients include UNSW, ABC, SBS, Garage Sale Trail and Inner West Council.</p>

Iâ€™ve been in Sydney for over six years, where Iâ€™ve worked as a Designer for Mobile Product Design studios and Agencies large and small.

Iâ€™ve been designing my whole life. I was raised in a small farming town in Victoria, Australia, where I learned to work hard, to take life easy, to never lose patience, and above all to value authenticity.

To me, design means going beyond the visual. Design means shaping a product experience from start to finish, iteration by iteration. Being an advocate for the user. Connecting the dots between what a client wants and what problems they are trying to solve. Bringing order from chaos and getting my hands dirty in the details.

This includes anything from translating concepts into wireframes and prototypes, to  defining a productâ€™s visual identity, creating polished UI design mockups, or creating an online style guide. Bringing everything to life with HTML, CSS and a bit of JS, whether that be developing templates or building a pattern library of UI components.

When I have time to myself, I like to grow chilis and figure out what to do with them, and Iâ€™ve been carrying my camera around the world.
