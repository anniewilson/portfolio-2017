<p class="large">Whilst working for XO Digital I worked on designing the company's first web presence. I designed this simple and fun one page scrolling website and developed it as a static site (html, css and js).</p>

I replicated the harsh angle from the block ’X’ shape in our logo by adding a persistent slash through the page as the user scrolls.

Even though it’s just a basic web presence, it’s a personal favourite of mine because the scrolling effect was so satisfying to complete. I’d been thinking about how I could make this angle element work all day—keeping that persistent angle on the cover image while keeping the two image layers aligned was proving to be a challenge. 

As I was drifting off to sleep at night, the trigonometry came to me and I had to jump up to implement it before the solution fled from my mind.
