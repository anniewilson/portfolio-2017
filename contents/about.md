<p class="large">Iâ€™m an Australian designer in Sydney. Iâ€™m currently working at [This Little Duck](https://thislittleduck.com), where I lead the design direction on our projects. Some of our clients include UNSW, ABC, SBS, Garage Sale Trail and Inner West Council.</p>

Iâ€™ve been in Sydney for over six years, where Iâ€™ve worked as a Designer for Mobile Product Design studios and Agencies large and small. My work includes anything from translating concepts into wireframes and prototypes, to defining a productâ€™s visual identity, creating polished UI design mockups, or creating an online style guide. Bringing everything to life with production ready front-end development (HTML, CSS and basic JS), whether that be developing templates or building a pattern library of UI components.

To me, design means going beyond the visual. Design means shaping a product experience from start to finish, iteration by iteration. Being an advocate for the user. Connecting the dots between what a client wants and what problems they are trying to solve. Bringing order from chaos and getting my hands dirty in the details.

Iâ€™ve been designing my whole life. I was raised in a small farming town in Victoria, Australia, where I learned to work hard, to take life easy, to never lose patience, and above all to value authenticity.

When I have time to myself, I like to grow chilis and figure out what to do with them, and Iâ€™ve been carrying my camera around the world.

## What I've been up to recentlyâ€¦

* Dabbling in a bit of 3d Modeling after being awestruck by [Monument Valley](https://www.monumentvalleygame.com/) ðŸ™Œ
* Flexing my design strategy muscle at [Climbing Strategy Mountain workshop](https://www.eventbrite.com.au/e/climbing-strategy-mountain-mindset-and-tools-to-amplify-your-value-tickets-33446973799#)
* Looking for that New (*York*) opportunity
