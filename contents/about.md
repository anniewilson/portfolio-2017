<p class="large">I'm an Australian Product Designer, with over 9 years creating beautiful product experiences. Currently leading design and spreading financial literacy at <a href="https://www.blackbullion.com/" target="_blank">Blackbullion</a> in London.</p>

I spend my working days fully embedded in our product design process, from user research, through concept development, prototyping, UX/UI, branding and visual design. Additionally I provide art direction across our marketing and content team, refreshing our brand and overseeing our junior design team.

When I'm not at work, I'm likely doing a spot of balcony-gardening or attempting to make something beautiful at pottery but failing and giving them as gifts to unsuspecting friends.
